# ▂▃▅▇█▓▒░ Who i am ░▒▓█▇▅▃▂
My name is Kirils Turkins, and I am a 16-year-old student residing in Germany. My journey in coding began at the age of 11, when I experimented with creating viruses using Batch and Visual Basic Script for amusement purposes. I also learned about hacking to protect myself after having been hacked several times.
Subsequently, I ventured into creating mods for Minecraft on the PlayStation 3, which was quite challenging at the time since there was no mod support, and one had to either jailbreak or download the mods as maps. Simultaneously, I honed my skills in creating 2D games with Unity and C#.
After a break of about two years, I resumed coding and began learning Java when I joined a new school, which I grasped in a few days due to my prior experience with coding. I continue to enhance my skills every day.
I am here on GitHub to develop a project portfolio for future employment, share my code with others, and collaborate with other programmers.

# ▂▃▅▇█▓▒░ What i do ░▒▓█▇▅▃▂
Currently, I specialize in coding desktop applications using Java. However, I am open to learning new things and expanding my knowledge. Expanding my Rust skills for the Slirik interpreter, which will be released soon in the future.
