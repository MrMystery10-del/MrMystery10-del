# ▂▃▅▇█▓▒░ Who i am ░▒▓█▇▅▃▂
My real name is Kirils Turkins, im a 16 years old student in germany. My first experience with coding is when i was around 11 years old by creating viruses with Batch and 
Visual Basic Script to troll friends and knowing how hacking works to protect my self from it, because i already got hacked a lot of times. Later on i started to create
Mods for Minecraft on the Playstation 3 which were one of the first mods during the time, because it was pretty hard and there were no mod support for it, so you needed
to jailbreak or download the mods as maps. At the same time i learned to create 2D games with Unity and C#. With 13 i stopped and had a big break for around 2 years
and then i joined a new school and i was forced to learn java, due my experience with coding itself i learned java in couple days, which was enough to proof to my 
school that i can code and i still learn everyday more and more. The reason im here on GitHub is to get a project portfoil for later jobs, share my code to others 
and working on projects not only alone.

Im open to every kind of new stuff to get better at game development and coding itself.
